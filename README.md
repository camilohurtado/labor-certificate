# labor-certificate
Enterprise dynamic labor certificate generator

This is a sample application based on a random enterprise. 
The main goal of this project is to generate dinamically a labor certificates of employees with all its information from a source of data where their info is persisted. Currently
it only supports RDBMS but the plan is to let the application be more pluggable depending on the datasource (employees data)

Currently the application does not has UI. It only works through API calls.
